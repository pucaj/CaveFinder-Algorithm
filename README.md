# CaveFinder-Algorithm
Algorithm that finds caves from txt file. Excercise for one of my course.

## Algorithm
This program find recursively biggest izolated cave in the 3D oriented cave, loaded from txt file. It also finds deepest cave from ground and number of izolated caves.

## Text file
If you want run algorithm for your text file, you must follow pattern from files in the bin/Debug directory
